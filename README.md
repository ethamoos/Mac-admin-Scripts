# Work in progress

As the name implies this is a folder of scripts that I am still working on. See the individual README files for general info, and the scripts themselves for more thorough details. In general, I have tried to only put scripts that have some aspect that I am trying to develop, or that I think might be useful to other people. Please let me know if you spot any bugs, or issues, or have any general comments.
