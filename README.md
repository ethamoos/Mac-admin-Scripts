# Mac admin Scripts

This is a repo of various scripts that I created for various Mac admin related tasks. See the individual README files for general info, and the scripts themselves for more thorough details. In general, I have tried to only put scripts that have some aspect that I am trying to develop, or that I think might be useful to other people. 

Whilst I hope that the scripts have no issues I give no guarantees that they do not contain any bugs so please test them carefully and with caution before using them in a live situation.
